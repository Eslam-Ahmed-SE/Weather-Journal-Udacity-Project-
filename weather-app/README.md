## About

The udacity weather jornal app project.

The project has an HTML page that have two inputs, zip code, and a feeling input.

The user enters the zipcode to get the weather.

The JavaScript takes the zipcode from the input and sends a request to the external api OpenWeatherMap and saves it to the local server api, and retrieves it to update the UI.

The local server api saves the data in a JS object for futur retrieval.
